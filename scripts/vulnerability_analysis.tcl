# Description: This script uses the fault injection script and the termination
#              monitor to determine the vulnerability of a curcuit to injected
#              faults (bit flips).
#              The script first runs the testbench without an injected error
#              to get a 'golden model' for the execution time and the final
#              internal state.
#              After creating the golden model, the script resets the simulation
#              and starts the testbench again and injects exactly one fault into
#              the simulation. The vulnerability analysis uses the
#              'inject_fault.tcl' script to inject faults. ***It is in the
#              responsibility of the user to configure the settings for the
#              fault injection***.
#              While the simulation is running and an errors is injected, the
#              script checks for the following 5 termination causes using the
#              termination monitor:
#               0) The termination monitor reports that the simulation
#                  terminated without errors and the internal state of the
#                  simulation with fault injections matches the internal state
#                  of the golden model. This case is the 'Correct' case.
#               1) The termination monitor reports that the simulation
#                  terminated without errors, but the internal state of the
#                  is not the same as the golden model. This case is the
#                  'Latent' case, as it terminated corretly, but more errors
#                  migth occur if the programm is allowed to continue running.
#               2) The termination monitor reports a program termination with an
#                  'Incorrect' signal.
#               3) The termination motitor reports an exception, or an invalid
#                  state ('x' or 'z') is detected on any other termination
#                  monitor signal.
#               4) The simulation takes more than 20% longer to finish the
#                  simulation compared to the golden model, indicating that
#                  the simulation is stuck in an infinite (or very long) loop,
#                  or encountered a dead-lock.
#              For every run of the vulnerability analysis the injection seed,
#              net name, injection time, termination time and the termination
#              cause is logged.

# ============ List of variables that may be passed to this script ============
# Any of these variables may not be changed while the vulnerability analysis
# is running, unless noted otherwise. Changing any of the settings during
# runtime may result in undefined behaviour.
# ---------------------------------- General ----------------------------------
# 'verbosity'         : Controls the amount of information printed during script
#                       execution. Possible values are:
#                       0 : No statements at all
#                       1 : Only important initializaion information
#                       2 : Important information and termination status of
#                           the running programm (Recommended). Default
#                       3 : All information that is possible
# 'initial_run_proc' :  User-defined procedure to be sourced before the
#                       execution of the golden model. The script should end
#                       with some form of the 'run' command to start running
#                       the simulation. If this setting is not provided by the
#                       user, then this script simply executes 'run -all'
# 'script_base_path'  : Base path of all the scripts that are sourced here:
#                        - termination_monitor.tcl
#                        - inject_fault.tcl
#                       Default is set to './'
# --------------------------- Vulnerability Analysis --------------------------
# 'initial_seed'      : The initial random seed that is used for the random time
#                       and net selection for the fault injection. The seed is
#                       increased for every injection test round.
#                       The default value is 12345.
# 'max_num_tests'     : Maximum number of tests. Default is 1.
# 'internal_state'    : A list of signals that compose the internal state of
#                       the simulated circuit. This list of signals is used
#                       to check for latent erorrs in simulations with an
#                       injected error. If internal state check is not required,
#                       leave this list empty (default).
# 'earliest_injection_time' : The earliest time the fault may be injected into
#                       the simulation. Default is 0.
# 'latest_injection_time' : The latest time the fault may be injected into
#                       the simulation. If set to 0, this variable will be
#                       set to the execution time of the golden model (Default).
#                       If set to a negative number, this variable will be
#                       changed to the execution time of the golden model plus
#                       this negative number.
# ------------------------ Termination Monitor Signals ------------------------
# 'correct_termination_signal' : Path to the testbench signal that indicates
#                       a correct termination of the simulation. Note that an
#                       'x' or 'z' on this signal is interpreted as an
#                       exception. This parameter MUST be provided by the user
#                       and has no default value.
# 'incorrect_termination_signal' : Path to the testbench signal that indicates
#                       an incorrect termination of the simulation. Note that an
#                       'x' or 'z' on this signal is interpreted as an
#                       exception. If no net is given for this signal, the same
#                       signal as for the exception monitoring is used.
# 'exception_termination_signal' : Path to the testbench signal that indicates
#                       an exception occured in the simulation. Note that an
#                       'x' or 'z' on this signal is also interpreted as an
#                       exception. This parameter MUST be provided by the user
#                       and has no default value.
# ------------------------------ Logging Settings -----------------------------
# 'log_latent_errors' : Log the internal state comparison results if the
#                       simulation terminates with id 1. For each mismatch,
#                       a new file is created.
#                       0 : Don't log the internal state comparison results
#                           (Default)
#                       1 : Log the internal state comparison results.
# 'log_net_list'      : A list of paths to nets that are to be logged during the
#                       simulation. If this list is empty, no nets are logged
#                       (Default).
# 'save_wlf_id_list'  : Save the logged waveforms of a completed injection
#                       simulation into a injection_<seed>.wlf file if it's
#                       termination id is in 'save_wlf_id_list'.
#                       Example: Setting 'save_wlf_id_list' to {2 3 4} will save
#                       the waveforms of all injected simulations that end with
#                       an incorrect result, an exception or a timeout.
#                       If the list is not empty, the waveforms of the golden
#                       model will also be saved as 'golden.wlf'.
#                       If this list is not empty, the simulation must log some
#                       signals, either in the 'initial_run_proc' or using the
#                       'log_net_list'.
#                       By default, this list is empty.
# 'monitor_signal_list' : A list of signals to be monitored during the fault
#                       injection. This script will count the number of times
#                       the signal changed its value and add this number to the
#                       vulnerability analysis log. Every entry in the list
#                       has the format {<User_Name> <path_to_signal>}.
#                       <User_Name> is an identifier chosen by the user that
#                       will be shown in the header of the logfile for the user
#                       and must be unique, as it is used as an identifier. The
#                       <path_to_signal> is the path to the signal (including
#                       the signal) that is to be monitored.
#                       For example: setting 'monitor_signal_list' to
#                       {{"Trig" /tb/dut/trig} {"Error" /tb/error}} will add
#                       "[...],monitors{Trig Error}" to the header and add
#                       for example "[...],{12 0}" to each entry in the logfile
#                       when /tb/dut/trig changed its value 12 times and
#                       /tb/error never changed its value during the script.
#                       Note that any change before 'earliest_injection_time'
#                       is not recorded.
#                       By default, this list is empty.
# --------------------------- Manual Mode Settings ----------------------------
# 'show_waves'        : Show the waves of the nets where faults can be injected
#                       in the default wave window.
#                       0 : Don't log and show the waves (default).
#                       1 : Log and show the waves.
# 'show_fault_in_waves' : Focus the currently active cursor in the currently
#                       active wave window to the time instance where the fault
#                       was injected. This can make debugging faster in manual
#                       mode.
#                       0 : Do not modify cursor and wave windows (default).
#                       1 : Focus the cursor and window time to the fault
#                           injection.
# ------------------------------- Parallel Mode -------------------------------
# 'thread_id'         : Indicates the ID of the current thread. Must be a
#                       non-negative integer smaller than 'num_threads' and must
#                       be unique for every parallel thread. The tread ID
#                       influences the seed that is used for the fault
#                       injection, and the name of the log file. Note that ALL
#                       variables (except for 'thread_id') given to this script
#                       must be equal for ALL parallel threads. The default
#                       value is 0.
# 'num_threads'       : Number of threads that are executing in parallel. The
#                       workload is statically divided amongst all threads. It
#                       is in the responsibility of the user to create
#                       'num_threads' threads that execute the workload.
#                       If the workload is not parallellized and only executed
#                       by a single thread, set 'num_threads' to 1 (default).
# ----------------------------- Underlying Scripts -----------------------------

# shoud / could be set:
#
# - Flip settings (mandatory):
#   - 'allow_multi_bit_upset'
